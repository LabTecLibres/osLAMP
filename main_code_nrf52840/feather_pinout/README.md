The file 'pca_10056.h' contains the pin definitions for the feather board.
Note that this custom definitions are based on the pca10056 board (nRF52840 DK).

The 'pca_10056.h' file must be placed in the directory of the nordic SDK (I used version 16.0.0):
'...\nRF5_SDK_16.0.0\components\boards\pca10056.h'
Its a good idea to have a backup for the original pca10056.h for the nRF52840 DK.
